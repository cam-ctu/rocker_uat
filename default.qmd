# Objective

This is set of user acceptance tests for docker images taken from [shug0131/cctu](https://hub.docker.com/r/shug0131/cctu). There is also a duplicate set of images on [github](https://github.com/cam-ctu/rocker_edit/pkgs/container/cctu)

These are the outputs from the github repository [rocker_edit](https://github.com/cam-ctu/rocker_edit), which itself is an embellishment of  [rocker project](https://rocker-project.org/).

With each version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) that is released, a corresponding image is built with a corresponding set of add-on packages harmonised to the latest date the R version was the most recent. The UAT done here runs the basic tests on the base package, recommended and add-on packages. Each version has its own subdirectory of testing with further details below.


```{r get_versions}
#| echo: false
# get json file and convert
df <- readLines("versions/versions.json") |>
  jsonlite::fromJSON() |>
  as.data.frame() |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    url=paste0("version_",version)
  ) 
# make table with links in it. 
df |> 
  dplyr::select(version, date, digest) |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(version)) |>
  kableExtra::kbl() |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling() |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1, link=df$url)
