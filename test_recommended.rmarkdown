# R code

This follows the recipe in the manual for basic R validation.  The tests have to be run in the R_home directory. This directory is then copied across into this project folder. The output files created are listed in the next section



```{r}
source("edit_log.R")
recommended_dir <- file.path(R.home(), "tests","recommended_tests")
unlink(recommended_dir,recursive = TRUE)
dir.create(recommended_dir)
success_recommended <- tools::testInstalledPackages(scope = "recommended", 
                                             outDir =recommended_dir,
                                             errorsAreFatal=TRUE)
edit_log("recommended packages",success_recommended )

system("rm -rf recommended_tests")
cmd <- paste("cp -r ", recommended_dir, " recommended_tests")
system(cmd)
source("mv_rout.R")
mv_rout("recommended_tests")
```
