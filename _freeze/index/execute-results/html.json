These function by running pre-written scripts to a) check that they run without errors b) the output that is produced matches up to pre-saved output files supplied with the download.\n\n<https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Testing-a-Unix_002dalike-Installation>\n\n# R System\n\nLocal CRSid: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nR.version\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n               _                           \nplatform       x86_64-pc-linux-gnu         \narch           x86_64                      \nos             linux-gnu                   \nsystem         x86_64, linux-gnu           \nstatus                                     \nmajor          4                           \nminor          4.0                         \nyear           2024                        \nmonth          04                          \nday            24                          \nsvn rev        86474                       \nlanguage       R                           \nversion.string R version 4.4.0 (2024-04-24)\nnickname       Puppy Cup                   \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSys.info()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                                                      sysname \n                                                      \"Linux\" \n                                                      release \n                                           \"6.8.0-48-generic\" \n                                                      version \n\"#48-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Sep 27 14:04:52 UTC 2024\" \n                                                     nodename \n                                               \"99adafdbb12a\" \n                                                      machine \n                                                     \"x86_64\" \n                                                        login \n                                                    \"unknown\" \n                                                         user \n                                                    \"rstudio\" \n                                               effective_user \n                                                    \"rstudio\" \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Tests\n\nWe now provide links to code and output that comes from running \n\n* [Base](test_base.qmd) tests with the  functions `tools::testInstalledBasic` and `tools::testInstalledPackages` for the software that ships directly without any add-ons\n* The [recommended](test_recommended.qmd) packages, that are included as default add-ons  using `tools::testInstalledPackages`\n* Our [bespoke](test_bespoke.qmd) in-house choice of further add-on packages  with `tools::testInstalledPackage`  (note the extra \"s\" or not in the function name)\n\n\n# Post processing summary\n\nThis data table shows what _should_ have been tested, and what has actually succeeded (0 is Success, 1 is Fail), along with date stamps\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload(\"log.Rdata\")\nlog\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                   name result                 date_stamp\n15          AsioHeaders      0 2024-11-21 11:14:46.825782\n16                   BH      0 2024-11-21 11:44:52.384098\n1                  cctu      0  2024-11-21 11:46:54.64161\n13                basic      0 2024-11-21 12:13:42.151635\n14        base_packages      0 2024-11-21 12:17:50.754158\n11 recommended packages      0 2024-11-21 12:33:31.290029\n12                abind      0 2024-11-21 12:43:31.553634\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::",
