> ## Regression test for bug reported by John Nolan:
> ##
> ## Whenever the pair (x[i], a[i]) == (0,1), NA would be returned, due
> ## to an internal computation of ( 0 * -Inf ) => NaN
> ##
> ## The code now checks for this particular issue and sets the value of
> ## ( 0 * -Inf ) to 0, which is correct for this calculation.
