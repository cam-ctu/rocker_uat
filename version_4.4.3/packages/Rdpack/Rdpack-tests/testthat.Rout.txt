_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Generate regular sequences.  ‘seq’ is a standard generic with a
     default method.  ‘seq.int’ is a primitive which can be much faster
     but has a few restrictions.  ‘seq_along’ and ‘seq_len’ are very
     fast primitives for two common cases.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     seq(...)
     
     ## Default S3 method:
     seq(from = 1, to = 1, by = ((to - from)/(length.out - 1)),
         length.out = NULL, along.with = NULL, ...)
     
     seq.int(from, to, by, length.out, along.with, ...)
     
     seq_along(along.with)
     seq_len(length.out)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     ...: arguments passed to or from methods.

from, to: the starting and (maximal) end values of the sequence.  Of
          length ‘1’ unless just ‘from’ is supplied as an unnamed
          argument.

      by: number: increment of the sequence.

length.out: desired length of the sequence.  A non-negative number,
          which for ‘seq’ and ‘seq.int’ will be rounded up if
          fractional.

along.with: take the length from the length of this argument.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Numerical inputs should all be finite (that is, not infinite,
     ‘NaN’ or ‘NA’).

     The interpretation of the unnamed arguments of ‘seq’ and ‘seq.int’
     is _not_ standard, and it is recommended always to name the
     arguments when programming.

     ‘seq’ is generic, and only the default method is described here.
     Note that it dispatches on the class of the *first* argument
     irrespective of argument names.  This can have unintended
     consequences if it is called with just one argument intending this
     to be taken as ‘along.with’: it is much better to use ‘seq_along’
     in that case.

     ‘seq.int’ is an internal generic which dispatches on methods for
     ‘"seq"’ based on the class of the first supplied argument (before
     argument matching).

     Typical usages are

     seq(from, to)
     seq(from, to, by= )
     seq(from, to, length.out= )
     seq(along.with= )
     seq(from)
     seq(length.out= )
     
     The first form generates the sequence ‘from, from+/-1, ..., to’
     (identical to ‘from:to’).

     The second form generates ‘from, from+by’, ..., up to the sequence
     value less than or equal to ‘to’.  Specifying ‘to - from’ and ‘by’
     of opposite signs is an error.  Note that the computed final value
     can go just beyond ‘to’ to allow for rounding error, but is
     truncated to ‘to’.  (‘Just beyond’ is by up to 1e-10 times
     ‘abs(from - to)’.)

     The third generates a sequence of ‘length.out’ equally spaced
     values from ‘from’ to ‘to’.  (‘length.out’ is usually abbreviated
     to ‘length’ or ‘len’, and ‘seq_len’ is much faster.)

     The fourth form generates the integer sequence ‘1, 2, ...,
     length(along.with)’.  (‘along.with’ is usually abbreviated to
     ‘along’, and ‘seq_along’ is much faster.)

     The fifth form generates the sequence ‘1, 2, ..., length(from)’
     (as if argument ‘along.with’ had been specified), _unless_ the
     argument is numeric of length 1 when it is interpreted as ‘1:from’
     (even for ‘seq(0)’ for compatibility with S).  Using either
     ‘seq_along’ or ‘seq_len’ is much preferred (unless strict S
     compatibility is essential).

     The final form generates the integer sequence ‘1, 2, ...,
     length.out’ unless ‘length.out = 0’, when it generates
     ‘integer(0)’.

     Very small sequences (with ‘from - to’ of the order of 10^{-14}
     times the larger of the ends) will return ‘from’.

     For ‘seq’ (only), up to two of ‘from’, ‘to’ and ‘by’ can be
     supplied as complex values provided ‘length.out’ or ‘along.with’
     is specified.  More generally, the default method of ‘seq’ will
     handle classed objects with methods for the ‘Math’, ‘Ops’ and
     ‘Summary’ group generics.

     ‘seq.int’, ‘seq_along’ and ‘seq_len’ are primitive.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     ‘seq.int’ and the default method of ‘seq’ for numeric arguments
     return a vector of type ‘"integer"’ or ‘"double"’: programmers
     should not rely on which.

     ‘seq_along’ and ‘seq_len’ return an integer vector, unless it is a
     _long vector_ when it will be double.
